# dotfiles
This is my repo for my custom commands that I am learning

# Additional Details:
-   List executables in local machine bin (ls -l "$HOME/bin")
-   How to comment out large sections of bash lines
        :<<'END_SCENARIO_2'
        END_SCENARIO_2

# Instructions:
-   chmod +x setup.sh
-   run the setup.sh "./setup.sh"
-   reload shell "source ~/.bashrc || source ~/.zshrc"
-   use functions (ie. "git ignore venv/")
